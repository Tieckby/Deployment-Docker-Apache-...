######################### How to create a background service on ubuntu #########################

It is (in general) no longer necessary to create bash files to manage the service, 
systemd takes care of everything (launch, stop, restart, status, log management, etc.)

These configuration files are located in /etc/systemd/system/ and make it possible to indicate 
the conditions for activating or deactivating a service, their owner, etc. 

Since this folder is essential for the proper functioning of your system, it is advisable to make a backup of it before any file modification.
In a terminal enter :

    sudo cp -r /etc/systemd/system /etc/systemd/system.save$(date +%Y%m%d)

Now create a service in system folder :
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/serviceName.service

The content will be :
    [Unit]
    Description=Some description of the service
    After=mysql.target (Which service will be start before this)


    [Service]
    ExecStart=Command to be execute on service start
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Now we can start the service :
    sudo service serviceName start
    sudo service serviceName status
    sudo service serviceName restart
    sudo service serviceName stop
